# Hi, I’m Viacheslav Tkachenko

I am a full-stack developer with an emphasis on best practices, developer experience, and programming design patterns. I hold a Master’s degree in Computer Science and am currently studying cloud architectures, with a particular focus on DevOps and microservices.

Beyond delivering products, I have created libraries, established standardizations, and recently started enjoying contributing to open source projects and participated as a speaker at company events.
